# midterm
This is my PHP midterm from my second year in the web development program at cna.

The quiz was the following:

PHP Midterm Application Assessment
Chapters 1 - 6
“What do you know about the Chinese zodiac signs?” Quiz
Base requirements
1. Create a Web form to present a ten (10) question quiz about the Chinese zodiac signs. You
must have a variety of True/False, Multiple Choice, & Fill-in-the-Blank questions. Indicate
that all of the questions must be answered for the quiz to be graded. Hint: Use radio buttons
or drop-down boxes for True/False and Multiple Choice answers.
2. Provide fields for visitors to enter their name and e-mail address. Notify the visitor that the
fields are required fields. Include Submit Quiz and Reset Quiz buttons.
3. Create a Web form handler to process the entered data when the Submit Quiz button is
clicked. Notify the visitor of the number of questions that are blank (if any) or if any of the
other required fields are missing. Redisplay the quiz if the form is incomplete; otherwise,
evaluate the answers.
4. Compare the visitor’s responses with the correct responses. Display each question and the
visitor’s response. If the visitor’s response matches the correct response, display the word
“Correct” (or a ✔) if the user’s response matches the correct response. If the user response
does not match the correct response, display “Incorrect” (or an ✘) and show the correct
response.
5. Display the reviewed quiz to the visitor with the number of responses that are correct out of
the number of total responses for a percentile score. The following line shows an example
output, but you may use your own wording.
You answered 8 out of 10 questions correct for a score of 80%.
6. E-mail the quiz results, including the visitor’s name and email address, to the visitor. Be
sure to include each question number, visitor response, and the correct answer if the
visitor’s response is incorrect. Show the visitor’s score, i.e. 8/10 = 80%.
7. Comment the code appropriately.

Extra Credit
Examples:
 Expand on Requirement #5 by including a different message based
on the number of questions answered correctly.

 Randomize the display order of the quiz questions and quiz answers
on the test for different visitors.
 Modify the page for the Midterm Assessment button in the Chinese
zodiac Web site to present the Chinese zodiac quiz. Write a
description of the quiz requirements and include the [Test the
Script] and [View the Source Code] hyperlinks.
 Create a PHP script to display the number of completed quizzes, the
number of times each question was answered correctly, and the
number of times each grade was achieved. Create a link to this script
from either the Midterm Assessment page or the quiz page.
